# Project: Investigative analysis and recommendations for HR recruitment using eye-tracker data for the assessment of empathy

The main goal of this python project is to use eye-tracking data to predict an individual's level of empathy. The projet builds a prediction model using machine learning approaches, such as RandomForestRegressor, DecisionTreeClassifier, and LogisticRegression with GroupKfold validation.

### Getting Started

This instructions will guide you to how to setup project on your local machine.

- To run this project, you'll need Python and the following main python libraries installed:

* pandas
* matplotlib
* numpy
* scikit-learn
* seaborn

###### You can install these libraries by using the following command:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

### Project Structure

CE_888 Empathy.ipynb : This file include main pipleline, features extraction, and train and evaluate model and example.

- Usage
  To run the project, simply execute the CE_888 Empathy.ipynb. This will preprocess the data, extract the relevant features, and train and evaluate the model's performance using cross-validation.
